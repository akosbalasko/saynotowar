Written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono

"All we are saying is give peace a chance" - The song was written by John & Yoko during their weeklong 'BED-IN' advertising campaign for Peace, held in Montreal, Canada in 1969. The film features the original 31 May 1969 recording of 'Give Peace A Chance' and includes John & Yoko appearing at the National Peace Rally in Bryant Park, New York on 22 April 1972 plus additional protest footage from the era. It concludes with the hundreds of thousands of shocked fans who, after John's sudden death, gathered for simultaneous vigils in Liverpool, London, New York and all around the world on 14 December 1980, to sing "Give Peace A Chance" and remember John.
